`<USER_SUMMARY> The user is working on a personal project named ORCHID-27. For company projects, the user's backend must use TypeScript with NestJS, and Python is not to be used for company backends. Python is still preferred for personal projects like ORCHID-27. The user's company project scope is BLUEBIRD-42.  Minh prefers Python and dislikes Java. When explaining code, Minh wants to use short examples. Minh is learning async/await and sometimes confuses coroutine with Task. Explanations on this topic should be presented as a timeline. Using a reused aiohttp ClientSession with a concurrency of 20 has been found to be an effective approach. Minh prefers Python for personal projects like ORCH`
